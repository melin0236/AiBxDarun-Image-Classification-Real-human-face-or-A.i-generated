# AiBxDarun-Image-Classification-Real-human-face-or-A.i-generated
A classification model for predicting if the image is a real human face or Ai-generated human face.

# Feature of This Model
This model can predict between real and fake (Ai-generated) human face images with performance more than 95% accuracy.

# Dataset used to train this model
The dataset are from 'ArtiFact: Real and Fake Image Dataset'.
Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/artifact-dataset
Github : https://github.com/awsaf49/artifact?tab=readme-ov-file

The folder in this Dataset that had been used are:
For the real images (30k images in total)
1. CelebAHQ
For the fake images (29,995 images in total)
1. StarGAN
2. SFHQ
3. FaceSynthetics

Then separate them into training dataset with 60% of total images, validation dataset with 20% of total images, and testing dataset with 20% of total images.
